## Progress report:

I worked on filtering text for the QA pipeline so we could filter out words that may be too difficult for 3-5 year olds to understand. I was also able to successfully integrate Chaquopy into the Android app.

## Some problems I encountered:
Since Java and Python sometimes have different types, it was sometimes hard to send information from Java and have it run in Python and I had to modify my code a lot to account for this.
