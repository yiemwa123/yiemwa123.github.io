## Progress report:

This week was continuing the work that I built off of the week before and also taking a look at other resources. I also coded a potential interaction scenario and tried to incorporate new ideas for interaction design (e.g. ask the user for a synonym rather than having the agent figure out if the clue provided is similar to the properties provided by ConceptNet).

## Some problems I encountered:
The most trouble I had came from trying to train the model on a different dataset. It would not read the file, or I would get errors.
