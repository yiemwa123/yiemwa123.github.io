## Progress report:

For this week, I incorporated Flask into the Android app and worked on reducing the amount of filtering needed to be done for when the agent makes a guess in order for the app to not be bogged down by runtime. I also figured out a way to test other images without using an Android device.

## Some problems I encountered:
The main issue was that the long run time for the QA generation caused the app to crash, so we decided to reduce the amount of text that was being used to generate QA pairs.
