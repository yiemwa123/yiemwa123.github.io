## Progress report:

I continued trying to code different interactions and was able to produce a basic command line version of the game and trying to improve that by implementing a ranking system for guesses. I also continued trying to play around with the question-answer generation and looking into other potential datasets that I could use.

## Some problems I encountered:
Not too many problems arose this week other than with training the model.
