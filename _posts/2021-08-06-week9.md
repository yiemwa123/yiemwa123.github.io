## Progress report:

I continued working on integrating the Python code into the Java code and supporting the ranking system in the Android app. I was also trying to look for ways to test other images besides the default image in the Android emulator. I also tried to explore ways to support a backend into the app to better integrate QA generation.

## Some problems I encountered:
The main issue was that it was difficult to test on a different set of images.
