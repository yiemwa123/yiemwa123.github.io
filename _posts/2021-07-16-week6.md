## Progress report:

I implemented interaction for when the agent is the spy and when the agent is the one providing the clue. Also tried to implementing some ideas of how to handle an interaction to allow the agent the "fail gracefully" so that even though the agent is not able to make a good guess, it can still be a valuable learning experience for the child. This week was also when I started to think of ways to improve upon ways the agent can give a guess or provide a clue.

## Some problems I encountered:
Most of the problems I encountered this week were related to how we wanted to program interactions where the agent is unable to provide a useful clue or an educated guess. We had to make a lot of assumptions as to what might be engaging for a child.
