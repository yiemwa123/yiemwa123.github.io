## Progress report:

I worked on integrating my code into the Android app and tried to look into ways to integrate a Python question-answer generation model into an Android app. I ended up settling on Chaquopy, which is a Python SDK for Android. I also looked into potential ways that we could store information locally and worked more on the ranking algorithm for guesses.

## Some problems I encountered:
I had a hard time debugging Chaquopy, since Google Voice on the Android emulator does not pick up my voice very well, so I had to find ways to modify the code to allow me to give an input without using voice.
