## About Me

Hi! I'm Yichen Wang, but most people call me Emma. I'm a rising senior (expected graduation May 2022) studying Information Science at Cornell University (College of Computing and Information Science). You can reach me at yw345@cornell.edu.

## About My Mentor

My mentor for this summer is Elizabeth Murnane, Assistant Professor in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. Her research is in human-computer interaction, focusing on applications in health, education, and sustainability. You can learn more about her [here](https://empower-lab.emurnane.host.dartmouth.edu/)

## About My Project

This summer I will be working on the development of AISpy, a speech agent capable of playing turn-taking, contextually-aware games with kids to support conceptual learning and commonsense knowledge acquisition. More specifically, my role involves developing functionality to query and process commonsense knowledge concepts and generating question-answer pairs using BERT.
