## About Me

Hi! I'm Yichen Wang, but most people call me Emma :) I'm a rising senior (expected graduation May 2022) studying Information Science at Cornell University (Department of Information Science). My research interests are a combination of human-AI interaction and social good! You can reach me at yw345@cornell.edu.

## About My Mentor

My mentor for this summer is Elizabeth Murnane, Assistant Professor in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. Her research is in human-computer interaction, focusing on applications in health, education, and sustainability. You can learn more about her [here](https://empower-lab.emurnane.host.dartmouth.edu/).

## About My Project

This summer I will be working on the development of AISpy, a speech agent capable of playing turn-taking, contextually-aware games with kids to support conceptual learning and commonsense knowledge acquisition. More specifically, my role involves developing functionality to query and process commonsense knowledge concepts and generating question-answer pairs using QA models. By collaborating with teammates, these features will be user tested in order to explore the game’s effects on children’s engagement levels, learning gains, and communication skills. Overall, my work will aim to contribute to new generations of interactive technologies that promote curiosity-driven educational experiences that are both fun and effective!
